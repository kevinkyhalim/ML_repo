<b> Conceptual Exercises </b>

Explain why a finding derived from data should be considered evidence rather than proof of a real-world phenomenon.

Describe at least two sources of uncertainty that are associated with every data-driven result.

Describe two techniques (quantitative or qualitative) that you can use to strengthen the evidence for the trustworthiness of a data-driven finding.

List at least two reasons why Professor Dickman’s calculations might not perfectly reflect the true number of animals that perished in the Australian bushfires.

Imagine that you had infinite resources (people, time, money, etc.) at your disposal. For the Australian bushfire example, describe the hypothetical data that you would collect and how you would collect it to answer the question of how many animals perished in the fires as accurately as possible. Be specific. What values would you measure, and how would you physically measure them? (Assume that you have access to a time machine and can travel back in time to the time period immediately following the fires to collect your data if you choose.)

In your own words, briefly summarize the predictability and stability elements of PCS to a family member who completely lacks any technical expertise.

What is the role of the validation dataset in assessing the predictability of a data-driven result?

Describe one technique that you could use for assessing the stability of a data-driven result.

Which splitting technique (group-based, time-based, or random) would be most appropriate for creating a training, validation, and test dataset split in each of the following scenarios:

Using historical weather data to develop a weather forecast algorithm

Using data from children across 10 Californian schools to evaluate the relationship between class size and test scores in other schools in the state of California

Using data from previous elections to develop an algorithm for predicting the results of an upcoming election

Using data from a random subset of an online store’s visitors to identify which characteristics are associated with the visitor making a purchase.

<b> Reading Exercises </b>

PDF files containing each of the papers listed here can be found in the exercises/reading folder on the supplementary GitHub repository.

Read “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” by Breiman (2001), and write a short summary of how it relates to the PCS framework. Don’t worry if this paper is a little bit too technical at this stage; feel free just skim it to get the big picture.

Read “Veridical Data Science” by Yu and Kumbier (2020), our original paper presenting a high-level outline of the ideas underlying the veridical data science framework.

Read “50 Years of Data Science” by Donoho (2017), and comment on the similarities and differences between Donoho’s perspectives and the perspectives we have presented in this book so far.

<b> Case Study Exercises </b>
Read the 2022 NBC News article “Chart: Remote Work is Disappearing as More People Return to the Office” by Joe Murphy (a PDF copy can be found in the exercises/reading folder on the supplementary GitHub repository, and the original article can be found here). Then answer the following critical thinking questions:

What is the preliminary conclusion of the article?

On what data is the conclusion based? How was this data collected?

Is the data representative of the population of interest?

List at least two assumptions that underlie the conclusion.

Does the title accurately represent the findings of the study?

Do you think that these results are (qualitatively) trustworthy? What additional evidence might you seek to determine whether the results are trustworthy?
