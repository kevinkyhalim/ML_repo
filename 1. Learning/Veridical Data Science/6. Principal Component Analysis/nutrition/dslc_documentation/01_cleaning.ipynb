    "## Domain problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for this project is to develop an app that can provide users with health and nutritional information about their meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying data that we will use for this project comes from the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) *Food Data Central*. The data dictionary can be found in the  `data/data_documentation/field_descriptions_apr2020.pdf` PDF file. If you plan on working with this data, we highly recommend that you glance through this document. Fukagawa *et al*.'s article \"*USDA’s FoodData Central: what is it and why is it needed today?*\" (also provided in the `data/data_documentation/` folder) provides an excellent summary of the variety of sources of information contained in this database. Refer to the PCS documentation for a more thorough summary of the data source (including the other datasets provided by USDA). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we focus on the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies  (FNDDS) food data survey, whose information was collected by the *What We Eat In America* dietary survey component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We originally downloaded this data in April of 2020, but the link we originally used to download the data is now broken (this is why it is helpful that we kept such meticulous notes about any websites that we download data from!). A new website for downloading the data can be found at [https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html) (as of late 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The FNDDS data contains 8,690 food items such as a bacon and cheese sandwich, honeydew melon, and carbonara pasta. Each food item has measurements from 57 different nutrients (variables), including iron, carbohydrates, fat, thiamine, riboflavin, and many more. \n"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will go through the recommended background information questions from the Data Cleaning chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *What does each variable measure?* Each variable measures the amount of a particular nutrient detected in 100g of the corresponding food item.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *How was the data collected?* ???Talk about how the measurements were collected\n",
    "\n",
    "- *What are the observational units?* The observational units are the food items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Is the data relevant to my project?* We don't quite have a sense of whether the food items included in the data are reflective of the generally available food items that we want to summarize in our app. One way we could check would be to go to the grocery store and to identify whether all of the food items are available in this dataset. Since we are just using this dataset for educational purposes, we won't do this, but if we were planning to put our eventual app into production, we would need to verify that the food items and nutrient measurements it contains are indeed relevant for a general consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Loading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this data in its raw format is quite complex, loading a workable version of the data into our environment will involve loading and combining multiple different tables, and filtering to the relevant portion of the combined dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three CSV files that are contained within the `data/` folder (`food_nutrient.csv`, `food.csv`, and `nutrient_name.csv`). Our first task is to combine the information spread across these files into a single object using common variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `food_nutrient.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "`food_nutrient.csv` is the main data file, which contains the amount of each nutrient for each food item. We will load this table in as `nutrient_amount`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The identifier for each food item is encoded in the key variable `fdc_id` and the identifier for each nutrient variable is encoded in the key variable `nutrient_id`.\n"

    "Thus, we decided to simplify this dataset by *manually* creating a *unique* nutrient description/name for each `nutrient_id`.  An alternative approach is to write some code that chooses one of the existing non-unique names. But this is a little tricky in this particular scenario because the formatting of the nutrient names are very inconsistent and the code to choose the most consistently formatted option for each nutrient would not be straightforward. This is an example of one of the very tedious manual cleaning tasks that we sometimes need to conduct for complex and poorly formatted data.\n",

The scatter plot of `fat` against the sum of `saturated_fat`, `monounsaturated_fat`, and `polyunsaturated fat` shows that `fat` is *almost* exactly equal to the sum of `saturated_fat`, `monounsaturated_fat`, and `polyunsaturated fat`. \n",

    "Two very common pre-processing steps in PCA analysis is to standardize (mean-center and SD-scale) the variables, and whether to *log-transform* the (non-negative) variables in order to make their distributions more Normal (since PCA, in theory, is more \"effective\" on Gaussian data). Neither of these steps are strictly *necessary* (although the *interpretation* of the principal components will change if you don't standardize the variables - see book for details). \n",
    "\n",
    "So that we can easily explore the impacts of these pre-processing steps in our PCS analyses, we will write a re-usable pre-processing function. Note that there is an option (which is defaulted to TRUE) to remove the moisture, alcohol, caffeine, and theobromine nutrients, since we decided that these did not fit into our idea of the kinds of nutrient types we want to summarize.\n",
