Contains both my learnings &amp; projects involving machine learning

1. Learning
- Applied Stats Learning: From one of my NUS master courses, covering concepts and applications from supervised learning (OLS, Splines, GAMs, Trees, SVM) to unsupervised (PCA & Clustering)
- Elements of Programming Interview: From the book with the same name
- Hands on Machine Learning: Documentation of the famous book by Aurélien Géron, coverig all the chapters!
- Pytorch: From the Youtube Channel [Aladdin Persson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S1dgHpqCdk&list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxeoooqP9rhU3HJIAVAJ3Vz)
- Regression & Other Stories: From the same book written by Andrew Gelman, though I need to revisit this if I want to solidify my Bayesian understanding
- Veridical Data Science: Data Science Life Cycle Framework (Predictability, Computability, Stability / PCS)

- With Claude: My own learnings guided by my interaction with Claude, acting as my tutor

2. Application
Not much work has been done for this as of now, but I plan to upload my kaggle competition code here.
